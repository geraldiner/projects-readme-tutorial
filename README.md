# About

This is the repo for a GitHub Action I created for the [2021 GitHub Actions Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-2021-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-4hn4) on [dev.to](https://dev.to).

## GitHub Action Overview
A workflow for updating the README file in all your repositories. This is especially helpful if you use a template and want to update a specific section with new information, e.g. an "Other Projects" section that needs to be updated with more recent projects.

There is a tutorial to go with it if you'd like to implement it yourself on [dev.to](https://dev.to/geraldiner/how-to-set-up-a-github-action-to-update-the-readme-file-in-all-your-github-repositories-4epj) and [Hashnode](https://blog.geraldiner.com/github-action-update-readmes-tutorial).
